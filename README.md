<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About this repository

Countries in the sub-Saharan African region (SSA) recorded their first cases and deaths from COVID-19 weeks later than Asia, North America and Europe. For example, South Africa, the first country in SSA to report over 100 cases on March 18, did so one month after Italy and two weeks later than the United States.

However, the trajectory of confirmed infections is following a similar path to other regions, crossing 10,000 confirmed cases just 25 days after it crossed 1,000. And only 50 days after the first case was reported. By comparison, it took more than 50 days for Western Europe, North America, South Asia and Southeast Asia to reach this point.â€¯ Latin America has been the only region that reached this point faster than in SSA.

This repository contains the code used to create visualizations to show the evolution of the pandemic in the region.
